# README

Create a `.env` file under the repository root folder and put your preferred PORT in it

```
PORT=4000
```

_Note_: Adding the below line to `.env` file would make `yarn build` process create a build directory with the `homepage` value as indicated in `PUBLIC_URL`. Do NOT do this in development environment

```
PUBLIC_URL=
```
